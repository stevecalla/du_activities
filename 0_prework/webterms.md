1) CMS: content management system is a system to manage content on a website like the descriptive text or images

2) API: application programming interface is used to get data from a source such as a database

3) WYSIWYG styles: what you see is probably what you get, relates to html and markup editors where code and macro tags sort of show what the result will eventually be (source: wikipedia)

4) MD: markdown language is a language used to format a document. i'm using a md file here but not apply the proper syntax to format this document

5) platform architecture: comprehensive computer systems for storing, delivering, and optimizing a variety of information, usually in an online format (source: practicaladultinsights.com); in my own words... a way to organize different parts required to make a website work... what is the front-end, backend tech to provide the UX/UI experience (layout, appearance, functionality) and the information on the site (such as via a database)

6) CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources (source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS); in my own words - is basically the URL for a website. the URL has different parts that provide information need to load the website

7) JavaScript: A coding language that adds interactivity to a website. For example, Javascript can interact with the HTML (layout) and/or CSS (styles/format) to change the background color of a website. Javascript can do much more. It can use APIs to get or change data on a database or it can calculate formulas or create complex interactivity for a game such as Wordle. From google search... a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine.

8) QA: Quality assurance (QA) ensures the product (e.g. website) performs the required functionality; complies/satisfy the objects set forth for the product from a variety of perspectives including UX/UI design, accessibility, functionality, performance/speed and more

9) Data wrangling tools: wrangling techniques that clean and convert source data into a standard format that can be used repeatedly according to end requirements (source google search). My words... bring data together in a consistent way so the end product is consistent, error free and reliable to statisfy the final use of the data

10) Node.js: Platform that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser (source google search). (and more from google search) Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use. My words... Node.js basically is an environment for running scripting and running javascript (as well as HTML, CSS and I'm sure more).

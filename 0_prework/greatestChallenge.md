Review the keys to success we outlined:

Overcome frustration.

Take charge of your learning.

Put in the time.

Be patient.

Get your hands dirty.

Try things on your own.

Team up.

Learn the art of using Google.

Make a plan.

Be an engaged student.

Prioritize self-care.

Identify which of these you think will challenge you the most. Write a brief paragraph (about 100 words) describing this personal challenge and the steps you'll take to overcome it.

Among many challenges the two big challenges will be (a) focus and (b) balance The first is keeping a focus on the task at hand. The world of coding is so vast with so many languages, tools, techniques, technology, and more. Not to mention that there are many many ways to solve challenges or satisfy requirements. Given my natural curiosity, this can lead to a never-ending process to find and refine solutions or to learn new, unrelated material that is super interesting and useful at some point but not necessarily for the task at hand. To address this issue, I will try to remain focused by clearly setting down in writing what I need to accomplish and then develop a step-by-step plan along with a pseudo-code for each step as I progress through each step. This will allow me to follow a roadmap with some room for discovery.


My second challenge will be to establish time domains or a time frame to accomplish a task so I have time in my life for balance. For things beyond coding boot camp. I will attempt to overcome this challenge by establishing a daily schedule that strives to tackle my commitment to coding with time blocks while leaving time for other activities.
